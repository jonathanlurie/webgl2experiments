# What?
This is a bunch of files to test WebGL2 features and have a better understanding of it. Each *test* folder is standalone and includes three files:
- `index.html`, to display the result in a browser
- `test.js`, that contains the Javascript
- `shaders.js`, that contains both the vertex and fragment shaders as Javascript strings
